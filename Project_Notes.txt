Geting information from rss with web scraping looking good but not soo sexy.
On XML format rss we have standation of data. "<item>" is generel <title>,<describtion>,<link> are what we want.
BUT on other format like "https://techcrunch.com/tag/rss/" we dont have standat table. For that we need to determine the link on xml format or not.

	To next step >> Plan the general map of project. Determine funtion and class structure.
